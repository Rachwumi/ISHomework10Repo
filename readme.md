# Event Manager Company: Software QA Analyst/Developer Onboarding Assignment

Welcome to the Event Manager Company! As a newly hired Software QA Analyst/Developer and a student in software engineering, you are embarking on an exciting journey to contribute to our project aimed at developing a secure, robust REST API that supports JWT token-based OAuth2 authentication. This API serves as the backbone of our user management system and will eventually expand to include features for event management and registration.

## Conclusion
  Throughout this project I faced many trials that were both difficult and exciting to figure out. Upon opening the folder I was overloaded with information, to the point that it was difficult to ascertain where to even begin. Naturally, upon reading the readme things began to make sense, but it was still going to be a tall task to finish the assignment. The hardest part when starting this project, was being able to get the test classes in a "all pass" state. This was because without the test clases I wouldn't be able to figure out how the api, schema, database, and other functionalities are intended to function. At the same time, because all of these functionalities were so new it was difficult to identify what was wrong, where it was wrong, and how to fix it. Slowly but surely, I was able to accomplish the task at hand. Being that I have a very limited amount of coding experience, debugging this project and identifying issues was genuinely the most time consuming and tedious portion of this assignment for me. It was hard for me to spot the differences between the JSON Request, outcome Response, and expected Response for the various router methods in the project, because many of the issues were so minuet and nuanced that without thinking about every possible interaction that can happen between a user and a system, you're almost guaranteed to miss it.

  This project helped me really understand what makes great software engineers and computer scientists so different from the rest of the pack. I never realized how many different outcomes, inside and out, of the requirements needed to be considered. At the same time, when you add in the collaborative effort that goes into large scale functionalities I gain an even greater appreciation for the work that they do. Just going through the process of identifying an issue, making the Github issue ticket, creating a branch, switching to that branch, completing the work there, then deploying it to Github, and finally merging it to the main branch both remote and locally was tedious by myself. So, when I think about scaling it up to Fortune 500 companies, and even the company I work for, I start to see why great software engineers are so sought after. I never once thought about how "fine comb" and "detailed" software engineers really needed to be when it came to building even the simplest of solutions, but this project and going through these small processes to make improvements to it really helped me understand it a lot better.
